# microstructure-dissipation-fits
MATLAB tools for extracting turbulent dissipation from BBTRE and NATRE microstructure profiles and fitting log-skew-normal and two-component lognormal distributions.

The microstructure data in .nc files can be directly downloaded from https://microstructure.ucsd.edu. These data can collected in 1D arrays by matlab codes in folders  dissipation_data_collect, and folders in PDF_fit contains code to do the fit for the distribution using two different approaches: log-skew-normal distribution of two-component log-normal distribution.
